So first consider the British national corpus (BNCCorpus), available through NLTK (see also [`British National Corpus, XML edition (ox.ac.uk)`](https://ota.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/repository/xmlui/handle/20.500.12024/2554)).

    "Now we would like to imitate the procedure mentioned in Neuman’s paper for type III semaphore. Write a program that identifies the occurrence of Noun-Adjective/Adverb part-of-speech in a given sentence. Then, use WordNet lexical database to find out the number of senses of each adjective. If every adjective has one single sense, then return, no metaphor. If the Noun has no entry in wordnet, then return UNKNOWN. Otherwise (adjective has more than one sense and noun has an entry in WordNet), then identify the set S of nouns in the BNC corpus that collocate with the given Noun of the given sentence (this corresponds to a set of nouns whose mutual information value is greater or equal than 3). Next, for each element (noun) of S, use the WordStat categorization to identify those who belong to concrete class. Let S1 be a subset of S, which contains these “concrete”-category nouns. If the number of elements in S1 is large, then restrict to the first three elements who have the highest mutual information values. Finally, to find out whether, whether the sentence containing adjective A and noun N is a metaphor, we need to test the compatibility of each elements of S1 with N. If there is no elements in S1 compatible with N, then we shall consider S as a metaphor, otherwise, it is not. To evaluate this compatibility, you can use the Wu and Palmer WordNet semantic similarity already implemented in NLTK. Therefore, assume that if the Wu and Palmer semantic similarity of at least of the nouns in S1 with N is greater than a threshold 0.4, then the compatibility between S1 and N is granted. (Note this is only a very rough approximation). Write a code that implements this reasoning and test it on two simple examples of your choice. Test this process for other values of threshold values (e.g., 0.3, 0.5, 0.6) "
